# Pipeline ETL Serverless Workshop

### Overview

This workshop guides you through building a **Serverless ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** on AWS to monitor and analyze revenue from community events.

The pipeline will **automate the entire data processing workflow** from multiple sources, helping to optimize costs, accelerate analysis, and reduce the risk of manual errors.
